Re-read the repo name... then if you're still stuck re-read this :)

This repo contains spoilers!

## Some commentary
Using AoC 2023 as a chance to try get familiar with rust ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ :)

Regarding day 3 - whatever I did I couldn't get rust working for whatever reason, so did it in Python instead (Python was the first language I learnt and am really familiar with it). Interestingly, having a tuple of symbols worked, but having a tuple of non-symbols (i.e. any digit or '.') did not. This is also some of the worst Python code I have ever written - please never code like this ğŸ˜‚

Day 4 was a lot of fun... part 2 takes my computer a hot second though.
