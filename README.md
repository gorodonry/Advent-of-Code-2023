Re-read the repo name... then if you're still stuck re-read this :)

## Some commentary
Using AoC 2023 as a chance to try get familiar with rust ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ :)

Apparently days 1 & 2 were unmemorable - unsure as to whether this is a good thing ðŸ‘€

Day 3 - whatever I did I couldn't get rust working for whatever reason, so did it in Python instead (Python was the first language I learnt and am really familiar with it). Interestingly, having a tuple of symbols worked, but having a tuple of non-symbols (i.e. any digit or '.') did not. This is also some of the worst Python code I have ever written - please never code like this ðŸ˜‚

Day 4 was a lot of fun... part 2 takes my computer a hot second though.

Day 5 solution for part 1 worked first try :D My first attempt at part 2 used over 70GB of RAM and froze my laptop B) Genuinely quite proud of my solutions for the past two days though.

Day 6. I keep being interrupted by dinner just when the problems are released. Pretty funny tbh.

Day 7 - managed my first implementations of structs, also first time using enums! Today's challenge was fun... after I read the task properly (took me like 5 tries, no wonder my code wasn't working)...

Took me waaaaayy too long to figure out that lcm(a, b, c) = lcm(a, lcm(b, c)) for day 8. Pretty chill once I figured that out - before that my solution worked, I just lost patience waiting for it to calculate the answer after 15 minutes went by.
